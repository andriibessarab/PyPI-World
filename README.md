# ðŸ“¦âœ¨ PyPI World

**PyPI World** is a web application that automates and simplifies the process of uploading packages to the Python Package Index (PyPI.org). This project was created to streamline a traditionally complex and manual process, allowing developers to focus on their code rather than distribution.

* **Intuitive UI:** Provides a user-friendly interface to manage project information, eliminating the need for complex terminal commands.
* **Rapid Deployment:** Reduces the time it takes to publish a package from hours to just a few minutes.

## Technologies

* **Backend:** **Python**, **Flask** (Python web framework), **SQLAlchemy** (ORM), **SQLite** (database).
* **Authentication:** **BCrypt** for secure password hashing.
* **APIs:** **GitHub API** (for repository access) and **PyPI API** (for package publishing).
* **Front-end:** **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the user interface.
